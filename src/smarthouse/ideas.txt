(check and manipulate state) some IP­enabled devices (stereo, tv, vcr, lamps, heater) in your

home from remote, so that you can go on vacation and need not worry about whether you

switched off the lights. This protocol should be accessible from a webpage or app and allow

you to configure your home devices with timers. You do not develop an app or web service ­

this is an exercise in specification and protocol design.

ideas for things to interface with.

log in, connect to the "nest" (House Server) Send a command to house server.
House server sends that command to the relevant appliance. Appliance reports back acknowledging command.
Should change variables to make sure its happening.  

MainFile -> start server (can listen and send premade messages) -> start appliances threads (sends premade messages and listen) -> start client thread (can read and write) -> client sends command to server 
-> server sends command to appliance -> appliance sends reply back to server -> sends that reply to client


send back to server format REPLY APPLIANCE ACK, could end up being REPLY APPLIANCE ERROR
